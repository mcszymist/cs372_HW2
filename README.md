# 372-Project-2
CPS to PostScript translator

Our program is used on the command line compiled using a makefile.

Makefile commands:
- all: compiles both PS_Translator.out and tests.out
- tests-run: compiles tests.out and runs tests.out
- run: compiles PS_Translator.out and runs PS_Translator.out
- clean: removes all object files and out files

Recommended command: ``` make -j8 ```
  
To create a postscript file: Create a vector holding all the shapes that are desired
Possible shapes are:
1. Simple
   - Circle
   - Triangle
   - Rectangle
   - Polygons with uniform sides
2. Complex - Compositions of shapes
   - Horizontal
   - Vertical 
   - Layered
3. Unique - Non-standard shapes
   - Circle with arcs


Files in project:
- build/ - Directory holding object files
- headers/ - Directory holding header files
- .gitignore
- ComplexShapes.cpp - implementation file for all complex shapes
- cps_test_suites.cpp - file holding all the tests for the project
- cps.cpp - implementation file for makePostscriptFile
- main.cpp - place to write code that will be turned into postscript by calling makePostscriptFile
- makefile - file for GNU make. Creates 2 executables:
  - tests.out - executable for running tests
    - ps.ps - postscript file generated by running the tests *File is ignored by git
  - PS_Translator.out - executable for main.cpp
- Shape.cpp - Base class that other shapes inherit from
- SimpleShapes.cpp - implementation file for all simple shapes
- testmain.cpp - main file for tests. 
- UniqueShapes.cpp - implementation file for all unique shapes
